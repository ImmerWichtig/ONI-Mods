# List of Mods
* [Tiny Worlds](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1971715008): Allows you to make smaller worlds in scale from 25% area up to default 100% area. Includes balance tweaks to make smaller world sizes playable and not crash world gen. Preview it on Github [here](src/SizeNotIncluded/README.md)
* [Pipsqueak Ice Sculpture](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1966804624): Adds another variant to the Ice Sculpture that is a statue of the pipsqueak. Looks like the style of the hatch ice sculpture. Preview it on Github [here](src/PipsqueakIceSculpture/README.md)
* [Mineralizer](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1952120897): Adds a Mineralizer building that is the opposite of the Desalinator. It produces salt water from water and salt. Preview it on Github [here](src/Mineralizer/README.md)
* [Roller Sakes](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1963899596): Adds a new critter species called Roller Snakes to the game. They are snakes that curl up into loops and roll around to move. Additionally has two new plants called Spiky Succulent and Aqua Bulb. These are all found in a new biome called the Desert or can be obtained in care packages on existing maps. The Desert biome is spawned in a new asteroid called Tetrament. Preview it on Github [here](src/RollerSnake/README.md)
* [Ethanol Geyser](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1810801031): Adds a guaranteed chilled ethanol geyser spawn to the rust biome. Preview it on Github [here](src/EthanolGeyser/README.md)
* [Infinite Liquid/Gas Sources](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1711115962): Adds infinite sources and sinks for liquids and gasses. Useful for sandbox mode testing. Preview it on Github [here](src/InfiniteSourceSink/README.md).
* [Advanced Storage](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1808602247): Adds a higher tier of storage containers to the game that all share the same inventory and that can infinitely compress their contents. Makes late game liquid and gas manage somewhat simpler for a heavy resource investment. Preview it on Github [here](src/TeleStorage/README.md).
