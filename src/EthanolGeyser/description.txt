[h1]Ethanol Geyser[/h1]

Adds a guaranteed uncovered chilled ethanol geyser spawn to the rust biome. The chilled ethanol geyser has the same liquid output as a cool slush geyser. This mod should **not** conflict with other world gen mods even if they create a new world type or modify the rust biome slightly. It will generate the one ethanol geyser on any map that contains the rust biome.

[h1]Problems/Help[/h1]

If there are problems with the mod please reach out on the (un)official Oxygen Not Included Discord where I hang around on the modding channels as @test447. I don't pay full attention to steam comments.
