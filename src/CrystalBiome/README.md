# Living Crystal Biome

## Critters
* Living Crystals:
    * The Cryolite Composite is a living crystal that sucks the thermal energy out of the environment. It does this by consuming mineral water, powering itself off the thermal energy inside the liquid, and then pooping back out the cooler mineral water. In this way they don't directly consume liquids, but they need a pool of liquid to drink from.
        * How does it fit the aesthetic: these are living crystals - very fitting to appear in a crystal biome.
        * How does it have a gameplay purpose: they act as a cooling device similar to the ICEfan and AETN.

## Plants
* Galvanic Outcrop: a large crystal formation that grows by slowly accumulating aluminum salt from mineral water. Needs to be fed a constant supply of mineral water but will leak the unused water back into the environment. Upon full growth it can be harvested for galvanic fragments.
    * How does it fit the aesthetic: these are crystal plants - they backdrop of the crystal biome.
    * How does it have a gameplay purpose: they act as a farmable power source. Unlike other power sources, this power source comes directly from farming. By spending duplicant labor and minerals to produce the crystals, the duplicants can then take the galvanic fragments to a power generator that produces a nice amount of wattage to keep their base running.

## Materials
* Raw Minerals:
    * Precursor Gemstones: the raw minerals that make up the crystal biome will be precursors to gemstones.
        * Corundum is a pinkish mineral. It will be one type of solid tile that makes up the majority of the crystal biome.
        * Sodalite is a cyan mineral. It will be the second type of solid tile that makes up the crystal biome.
        * How does it fit the aesthetic: with both of these materials being minerals (i.e. crystals) they will very appropriately make up the solid tiles in the crystal biome.
        * How does it have a gameplay purpose: all biomes must be made up of large amounts of raw mineral that the player may use as a building resources. These are the raw minerals the make up the crystal biome.
    * Aluminum Salt: salt made from aluminum rather than sodium.
        * Behavior: unable to be turned in table salt. Instead may be refined into Aluminum metal in the metal refinery or refined into aluminum metal tiles by heating to above 200 degrees celsius. Additionally used as the material to represent the mineral component of mineral water.
        * How does it fit the aesthetic: both minerals in the biome are made of aluminum. An aluminum salt (aluminum acetate) may be an appropriate way to represent the minerals when dealing with aqueous solutions.
        * How does it have a gameplay purpose: necessary to allow for the player to desalinate mineral water and for the player boiling mineral water into steam.
* Liquids:
    * Mineral Water: mineralized water - differs from salt water since salt water is water + salt whereas mineral water is water + aluminum salt.
        * Behavior: can be run through a desalinator like salt water to produce water + aluminum salt. Additionally can be produced from the mineralizer building from water + aluminum salt or corundum or sodalite. When boiled, it leaves behind aluminum salt upon conversion to steam.
        * How does it fit the aesthetic: since biomes should have some form of liquid, the crystal biome can have a pinkish liquid in the form of mineral water. Since the biome is designed around crystals, having a form of crystal dissolved in water like the new idea of salt dissolved in water should be reasonable.
        * How does it have a gameplay purpose: when the player is getting started and expanding their base, they will run into pockets of mineral water that they can convert to normal water for crops or electrolyzer-based oxygen. Later, the player may use mineral water directly to grow their crystal plants.
* Manufactured Materials:
    * Gemstones: polished versions of the precursor gemstones. Useful for improving decor.
        * Polished corundum: pink gemstone.
        * Polished sodalite: cyan gemstone.
        * How does it fit the aesthetic: gemstones are fitting for a crystal biome.
        * How does it have a gameplay purpose: if the player wants to boost the decor of their base, they can use polished gemstones as an alternative to refined metals for high decor.

## Buildings
* Mineralizer: consumes water and minerals to produce mineral water. Aluminum salt, corundum and sodalite all are considered minerals. Requires a small amount of power to be run. Does not require duplicant labor. The art aesthetic should be either a large blender or washing-machine.
    * How does it fit the aesthetic: should be made in line with the game's building art style. A 2x3 building size would be effective for representing a blender or a 3x2 building size would be good for a washing-machine. The building can use some slight scaling in and out to represent work. In addition to having moving parts.
    * How does it have a gameplay purpose: necessary to allow the player to have a larger source of mineral water than just the starting reserves that are created on world generation. Part of the crystal power system since it is necessary to have mineral water to grow the galvanic outcrops.
* Rock Polisher: takes in either sodalite or corundum (raw minerals) and produces polished gemstones. These polished gemstones will act as the equivalent of diamond or glass for the purpose of creating window tiles for the duplicants to get bonus decor. Additionally these gemstones should be used to create a new type of statue. These new statues would be only made from polished gemstone and provide an equivalent base decor as a metal statue but require far less setup since the rock polisher will be easier to run than the metal refinery. This building will not require duplicant labor but will require a small amount of power. It does not consume any liquids or gasses. Fairly analogous to the kiln. It will lose a significant amount of mass in the polishing process since polishing quite literally is an abrassive process.
    * How does it fit the aesthetic: it is another crystal related building since it takes in minerals and produces gemstones - very fitting to create gemstones from a crystal biome.
    * How does it have a gameplay purpose: it allows for an alternative way to improve the decor of the base without needing to go for refined metals.
* Crystalline Contraption: power station that runs on galvanized fragments. Alternative to ethanol and petroleum power (mid game power solution). Like a coal generator it just needs to be provided the galvanized fragments and it will run. This makes it possible to get some amount of power generation from wild plants but the real power generation will be from the player farming galvanic outcrops.
    * How does it fit the aesthetic: turning crystals into power allows the crystal biome to have its central idea of crystals hook into core gameplay
    * How does it have a gameplay purpose: it allows for an alternative way to handle mid game power trouble.

## Research
* The crystalline contraption will be unlocked with the same research as the hydrogen generator.
* The mineralizer will be unlocked with the same research as the desalinator since they basically inverse/equivalent buildings.
* The rock polisher will be unlocked with the same reserach as the rock crusher since they both are a refinement method.
* The ability to use gemstones for window tiles will be unlocked with the window tile research since the gemstones will simply be added to the list of materials that can be used to make window tiles.
* The gemstone statues will be unlocked with the same research as the metal statue. This is because it will use the same art assets as the ice sculpture but should not be considered the same building since the material type is far too different.

## Gameplay Loop
* Cooling: if things are too hot you can create a heatsink by insulating a Cryolite Composite ranch.
* Decor: you can use gemstones as an alternative route to high tier decor compared to diamond and refiner metals.
* Power: galvanized fragments provide a passive power source from wild plants and a way to generate midgame power that doesn't rely on oil or ethanol.
    * Details: the player will use a mineralizer to convert the sodalite and corundum that they dig up into mineral water which will feed their galvanic outcrops which will create galvanic fragments that power their crystalline contraptions. This essentially turns the entire crystal biome into a source of consumable ore, somewhat similar to a really large pocket of coal, but much longer lasting for a bit more initial investment in infrastructure.

## Biome Description
The crystal biome has a color scheme of cyans and pinks. It is composed of solid sodalite and corundum, liquid mineral water pools, and oxygen gas. Cryolite Composites can be found wandering the biome and Galvanic Outcrops grow in the wild here. It has a temperature in between the starting biome and the cold biome ~5 degrees celsius because this is enough to be considered cold by the game but not enough to be a hugely useful heat sink.
