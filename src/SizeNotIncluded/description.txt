[h1]Tiny Worlds[/h1]

Changes all world gen in the game to make smaller worlds. Designed either as a fun challenge or as a way to get more performance on lower-end computers.

[h1]From 256x384 to 128x192[/h1]
The world is 2x smaller in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions. This means you only have 1/4x the area to work in which means the game only has to simulate 1/4x the world.

[h1]Balanced for Playability[/h1]
Despite being smaller the worlds are still balanced for a good normal game playing experience.

[list]
[*] Biome sizes are made smaller so all the biomes still fit on the map.
[*] Ores and resources are made x4 so you will not run out of important things like [b]Metal Ores[/b], [b]Fossil[/b], and [b]Algae[/b]. For example if in the normal world a tile would generate with 340kg of [b]Copper Ore[/b] then on a [b]Tiny World[/b] it will generate 1360kg instead.
[*] Critters are more dense so you won't run out. Even though the map is smaller you will still get about the same amount of critters total.
[/list]

[h1]Customizing World Size[/h1]
You can choose the exact world size you want by going into the mod settings. To find settings open the mod menu in game, scroll down to [b]Tiny Worlds[/b] and click on [b]Options[/b] to choose your world size. Pick between the normal world ratio and tall worlds that are much taller than wide. Sizes range between [b]Smallest[/b], [b]Small[/b], [b]Medium[/b], [b]Large[/b], and [b]Default[/b] where [b]Default[/b] is the standard world size and everything else is smaller. Some traits are disabled from worlds between [b]Smallest[/b] and [b]Medium[/b] in size. These traits are [b]Glaciers[/b] and [b]Large/Medium/Mixed Boulders[/b]. All of the balance changes from above are scaled to fit your world size. So on a default world, no balance changes are applied to world gen and the changes scale from least affect to most affect from [b]Large[/b] to [b]Smallest[/b] world.

[h1]Problems/Help[/h1]

If it crashes or hangs during world gen you should try restarting and trying again as a first solution. This is because world gen is finicky and although I have done my best to make sure world gen won't crash there is still small possibility it will not work correctly with modification.If there are problems with the mod please reach out on the (un)official Oxygen Not Included Discord where I hang around on the modding channels as @test447. I don't pay full attention to steam comments.
