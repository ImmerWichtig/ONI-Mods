[h1]Pipsqueak Ice Sculpture[/h1]

Adds a new variant to the ice sculpture to show a pipsqueak as an alternative to the ice sculpture of the hatch. That's literally all this mod does. Happy decorating!

If there are problems with the mod please reach out on the (un)official Oxygen Not Included Discord where I hang around on the modding channels as @test447. I don't pay full attention to steam comments.
